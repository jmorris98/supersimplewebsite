        <h1>Is Life Like a Website</h1>
        <h2>Are we connected like a web?</h2>
        <h3>Or are we trapped in a web?</h3>
        <h4> <a href="http://www.weather.com" target="_blank">We can't break free </a> in life.</h4>
        <h5>Does that mean we can't free ourselves from the web?</h5>
        <h6>Oh well. It be like that sometimes :|</h6>
    What's the point in anything? Is there a point? <b> What is a point? </b>

    <p>
       <b>Points</b> are dots used to establish placement somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Points</i> are used to keep scores. At least in tennis, you can have love as a point.
    </p>
    <hr>
   <em>Points</em> are used to make statements. Our lives aren't statements because we always question ourselves.<br>
